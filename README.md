# Programming Logic and Algorithm Design
This course provides students with a basic understanding of programming development practices starting from designing algorithm based on the fundamental concept of Programming logic. Concepts covered will include the application of algorithms and logic to the design and development of procedural programs to address the problem solving procedure required in computer programming field. This course will cover procedural programming concepts including data types, controls structures, iterations, functional decomposition, arrays and input validation.


ASSIGNMENT-1 [ASSIGNMENT 1_complete.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Programming-Logic-and-Algorithm-Design/files/7597015/ASSIGNMENT.1_complete.pdf)

Task 1 [Write a pseudocode & C Code]
1.	Given an integer number in seconds as input, print the equivalent time in hours, 
minutes, and seconds as output. The recommended output format is something like: 
7,322 seconds is equivalent to 2 hours 2 minutes 2 seconds.

2.	If a four digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to
obtain the sum of the first and last digit of the number. 

3.	Print the range of a number. E.g. number 78 is between 70 and 79, 102 is
between 100 and 109. 

4.	Write an algorithm/pseudo code to determine the type of a triangle
depending upon the value of the sides. [only pseudo code] 

Task 2 
Write an algorithm as well as draw a ﬂowchart for the following:

Input
 the item ID number
 the Number On Hand
 the Price per item
 the Weight per item in kg
 the Number Ordered
 the Shipping Zone (1 letter, indicating the distance to the purchaser)
Processing
The program will read each line from the user and calculate the following:
Total Weight = Weight Per Item * Number Ordered
Weight Cost = 3.40 + Total Weight / 5.0
Shipping cost is calculated as follows:
If Shipping Zone is ‘A’
Then Shipping Cost is 3.00
If Shipping Zone is ‘B’
Then Shipping Cost = 5.50
If Shipping Zone is ‘C’
Then Shipping Cost = 8.75
Otherwise Shipping Cost is 12.60
Handling Charges = 4.00, a constant
New Number On Hand = Number On Hand Number Ordered
Discount is calculated as follows:
If New Number On Hand < 0
Then Discount = 5.00
Else Discount = 0
Here the purchaser is being given a discount if the item has to be repeat ordered. Total cost is calculated as follows:
Total Cost = Price of Each * Number Ordered + Handling Charge + Weight Cost + Shipping Cost – Discount

For each purchase, print out the information about the purchase in a format approximately like this:
Item Number: 345612
Number Ordered: 1
Number On Hand: 31
Price of Each: 19.95
Weight of Each: 3
Shipping Zone: A
Total Cost: 30.95

After all the purchases are finished, print two lines stating the total number of purchases and the total cost of all purchases.


ASSIGNMENT-2[Assignment 2 COMPLETE.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Programming-Logic-and-Algorithm-Design/files/7597123/Assignment.2.COMPLETE.pdf)

A program that prompts the user to enter the date as three integer values for the month, the day in the 
month, and the year. The program should then output the date in the form 31st December 2003 when the 
user enters, say 12 31 2010. The program has to work out when superscripts “th”, “nd”, “st”, and “rd” need 
to be appended to the day value. The programmer should not forget 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th; and then 11th, 
12th, 13th, 14th; and 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.

Tasks
-	Constructs an IPO table
-	Draw flow chart
-	Write a C code with appropriate comments

MINI PROJECT [MINI PROJECT_COMPLETE.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Programming-Logic-and-Algorithm-Design/files/7597212/MINI.PROJECT_COMPLETE.pdf)

Write a menu-based program in C that uses a set of functions to perform the following operations 
Task 1
To 
(a) reading a complex number 
(b) writing a complex number
(c) addition of two complex numbers
(d) subtraction of two complex numbers
(e) multiplication of two complex numbers
Task 2
To perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two matrices depending upon the user’s choice.
Note: Apply input validation for both tasks.
